### Hi there, thanks for checking out my profile 👋🏻

I’m studying computer science at Dartmouth, and I’m passionate about leveraging technology to empower businesses ✨ I care for the social good, and I try to ground my work in the benefit of individuals, communities, and the environment 🍀

In terms if software engineering, I enjoy in particular data engineering, data analysis, AI broadly, and machine learning specifically. A lot of my previous work experiences and projects have quite focused on those areas.

Apart from software engineering, I  enjoy all types of digital design from UI/UX, posters, prints, to graphic design 🎨 When I freestyle, my designs naturally tend to focus on Middle Eastern culture and Arabic scripts 🌸 I believe in the value of using digital design as a visual tool for political and social change.

If you're an individual looking for a digital designer for freelance work, please feel free to reach out. I'm also always happy to connect with new people ❤️

And as always, free Palestine 🇵🇸 Women, Life, Freedom 🦋 trans lives matter 🏳️‍⚧️ and Black Lives Matter ✊🏿
